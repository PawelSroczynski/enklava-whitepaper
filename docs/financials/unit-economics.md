# Unit Economics

The Climate Fortress is designed for **incremental deployment** — start with a minimum viable habitat and expand based on needs and resources.

---

## The 6-Stage Incremental Path

### Stage 1: Yurt Pioneer (Entry Point)

**Investment:** €3,000 - €5,000

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Yurt Structure (5-6m diameter) | €2,000 - €3,500 |
| Basic Insulation | €500 |
| Platform/Foundation | €500 - €1,000 |

**What You Get:**
- Year-round shelter (with proper insulation)
- Minimal footprint (~25m²)
- Proof of concept

**Limitations:** No utilities, seasonal heating challenge, temporary classification

---

### Stage 2: Off-Grid Basics

**Investment:** €8,000 - €12,000 (cumulative)

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Previous stage | €3,000 - €5,000 |
| Solar Kit (2kW) | €2,500 |
| Battery Storage (5kWh) | €1,500 |
| Composting Toilet | €500 |
| Rainwater Collection | €500 |

**What You Get:**
- Energy independence (basic)
- Water resilience
- Sanitation solution

---

### Stage 3: Bio-Panel Upgrade

**Investment:** €25,000 - €35,000 (cumulative)

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Previous stages | €8,000 - €12,000 |
| Bio-Panels (35m² shell) | €12,000 - €15,000 |
| Professional Foundation | €5,000 - €8,000 |

**What You Get:**
- Permanent structure classification
- Superior insulation (R-40+)
- 30+ year lifespan
- Resale value

**Transition:** The yurt can be repurposed as guest space, workshop, or sold.

---

### Stage 4: Power Node

**Investment:** €40,000 - €50,000 (cumulative)

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Previous stages | €25,000 - €35,000 |
| Expanded Solar (5kW) | €5,000 |
| Battery Bank (15kWh) | €4,000 |
| Inverter/BMS | €2,000 |
| Gasifier (heating) | €3,000 - €4,000 |

**What You Get:**
- Full energy autonomy
- Winter heating solution
- Grid-independent operation

---

### Stage 5: Aqua Node

**Investment:** €50,000 - €60,000 (cumulative)

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Previous stages | €40,000 - €50,000 |
| Well/Borehole | €3,000 - €5,000 |
| Filtration System | €1,500 |
| Hot Water (solar thermal) | €2,500 |
| Greywater Treatment | €2,000 |

**What You Get:**
- Complete water independence
- Year-round hot water
- Closed-loop water system

---

### Stage 6: Climate Fortress (Complete)

**Investment:** €65,000 - €85,000 (cumulative)

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Previous stages | €50,000 - €60,000 |
| Interior Fit-Out | €7,000 - €10,000 |
| Food Production (greenhouse) | €5,000 - €8,000 |
| Monitoring/Automation | €3,000 - €5,000 |
| Contingency | €2,000 |

**What You Get:**
- Full autonomy (energy, water, food basics)
- Smart monitoring
- Complete Climate Fortress status

## Stage Comparison

| Stage | Investment | Autonomy | Time to Deploy |
|-------|------------|----------|----------------|
| 1. Yurt Pioneer | €3-5k | Shelter only | 1-2 weeks |
| 2. Off-Grid Basics | €8-12k | Energy/water basics | 1-2 months |
| 3. Bio-Panel Upgrade | €25-35k | Permanent shelter | 2-3 months |
| 4. Power Node | €40-50k | Energy autonomous | 3-4 months |
| 5. Aqua Node | €50-60k | Water autonomous | 4-5 months |
| 6. Climate Fortress | €65-85k | Full autonomy | 6-12 months |

## Expansion Economics

Once you have a core Climate Fortress, expansion costs decrease:

| Configuration | Size | Cost/m² | Total |
|---------------|------|---------|-------|
| Core Unit | 35m² | ~€2,000 | €70,000 |
| + Extension | 70m² | ~€1,400 | €98,000 |
| + Workshop | 105m² | ~€1,200 | €126,000 |
| Full Estate | 140m² | ~€1,000 | €140,000 |

The marginal cost per m² drops significantly after the core systems are in place.

## Revenue Potential

Each complete Climate Fortress can generate income:

| Revenue Stream | Monthly | Annual |
|----------------|---------|--------|
| Hospitality (Airbnb) | €800-1,500 | €9,600-18,000 |
| Workshop Hosting | €200-500 | €2,400-6,000 |
| EnklavaLab Affiliate | €50-100 | €600-1,200 |
| **Combined** | **€1,050-2,100** | **€12,600-25,200** |

*Payback period at median utilization: 3-5 years*
