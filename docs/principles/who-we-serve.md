# Who We Serve

Enklava serves four distinct avatars. Each enters the ecosystem differently, needs different things, and creates different value.

---

## Avatar A: The Glamping Investor

### Who They Are
Entrepreneurs and investors looking to enter the eco-hospitality market. They have capital but lack technical knowledge. They want **ROI**, not philosophy.

### Pain Points
- "I see glamping is booming but don't know how to start"
- "Traditional hospitality has razor-thin margins"
- "I want passive income, not another job"
- "Eco-tourism seems promising but I don't trust the build quality"

### What They Want
| Need | Enklava Solution |
|------|------------------|
| Proven business model | Franchise system with documented unit economics |
| Turnkey operation | KIT + assembly + training package |
| Marketing support | Brand association + booking platform |
| Risk mitigation | Quality guarantees + operational SOPs |

### Entry Point
**ROI Calculator Kit** (47 PLN) — Shows occupancy rates, margins, payback period for their specific location.

### Journey
```
ROI Kit → Site Assessment → Franchise Agreement → KIT Purchase → Assembly → Launch → Royalties
```

### Lifetime Value
**40,000 - 100,000+ PLN** (franchise fee + ongoing royalties + expansions)

---

## Avatar B: The Self-Builder

### Who They Are
DIY-oriented individuals who own or plan to buy land. They want to build themselves but need guidance. They value **independence** over convenience.

### Pain Points
- "Construction companies charge 3x for 'eco' label"
- "I want to learn, not just buy"
- "Information online is scattered and contradictory"
- "Building codes seem impossible to navigate"
- "I don't want a mortgage"

### What They Want

|------|------------------|
| Clear instructions | Step-by-step SOPs with video |
| Material sourcing | Verified supplier directory |
| Community support | EnklavaLab + Toloka network |
| Legal navigation | Template documents + consultation |

### Entry Point
**Digital Handbook** (150-200 PLN) — Complete build guide with CAD drawings, BOM, checklists.

```

### Lifetime Value
**25,000 - 40,000 PLN** (handbook + subscription + KIT materials)

---

## Avatar C: The Special-Use Buyer

### Who They Are
Professionals needing a unique space: yoga instructors, therapists, artists, retreat centers, Airbnb hosts. They want **one structure** for a specific purpose.

### Pain Points
- "Traditional construction is too expensive for my use case"
- "I need something beautiful AND functional"
- "Permits for permanent structures are a nightmare"
- "I want something that stands out from competitors"

### What They Want
| Need | Enklava Solution |
|------|------------------|
| Fast deployment | Pre-fab yurt, 3-5 day assembly |
| Aesthetic appeal | Handcrafted, Instagram-worthy |
| Flexibility | Temporary structure = easier permits |
| Differentiation | "The only yurt yoga studio in the region" |

### Entry Point
**Use-Case Guide** (free content or 27 PLN) — Examples of therapy yurts, yoga spaces, creative studios.

### Journey
```
Use-Case Guide → Consultation → Single Yurt Purchase → Assembly → (Maybe) Second Unit
```

### Lifetime Value
**15,000 - 30,000 PLN** (single or double yurt purchase)

---

## Avatar D: The Enklava Builder

### Who They Are
Vision-aligned individuals who want the **full sovereignty stack**. Not just a house — a complete transition from dependent consumer to autonomous producer. The true believers.

### Pain Points
- "I don't just want a house, I want a new way of life"
- "Current systems are fragile and I want out"
- "I'm willing to invest time and money for real independence"
- "I want to be part of building something bigger"

### What They Want
| Need | Enklava Solution |
|------|------------------|
| Complete system | Full Climate Fortress + energy + water + food |
| Community | Settlement membership, not isolated cabin |
| Participation | Governance rights, token ownership |
| Legacy | Something to pass to next generation |

### Entry Point
**Whitepaper + EnklavaLab** — They read everything. They want the vision before they buy.

### Journey
```
Whitepaper → EnklavaLab → Toloka Contribution → Genesis Voucher → Climate Fortress → Settlement Membership → Governance Participation
```

### Lifetime Value
**100,000+ PLN** over 3-5 years (subscription + tokens + full build + ongoing participation)

## Avatar Distribution Strategy

| Avatar | % of Leads | % of Revenue | Priority |
|--------|------------|--------------|----------|
| **A** (Investor) | 10% | 35% | High-touch sales |
| **B** (Builder) | 40% | 30% | Content + community |
| **C** (Special-Use) | 35% | 15% | Product pages + SEO |
| **D** (Enklava) | 15% | 20% | Vision content + token |

---

## The Conversion Insight

Avatars can migrate:

- **C → B**: Special-use buyer decides to build their own home
- **B → D**: Self-builder catches the full vision
- **A → D**: Investor becomes a believer, moves to settlement

The funnel isn't linear. **Content for Avatar D attracts all avatars** — the vision sells. Then we segment by behavior and serve appropriate products.
