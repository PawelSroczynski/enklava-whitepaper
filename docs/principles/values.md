# Core Values

> *"Values are what you do when no one is watching."*

These five values guide every decision at Enklava — from protocol design to partner selection to daily operations.

---

## 1. Sovereignty Over Dependency

**We build systems that free people, not lock them in.**

| Dependency Model | Sovereignty Model |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Rent your energy from utilities | Generate and store your own |
| Borrow from banks for 30 years | Build debt-free with community labor |
| Buy food from global supply chains | Grow and preserve locally |
| Store data on corporate servers | Own your data on local-first systems |

**In practice:**
- Every system we design can be built, repaired, and operated locally
- No proprietary lock-in — open-source by default
- Users can fork, modify, and improve without permission
- Exit is always possible — no captive customers

---

## 2. Regeneration Over Extraction

**We leave places better than we found them.**

Traditional development extracts value: clear the land, build fast, move on. Enklava inverts this:

| Extraction | Regeneration |
|------------|--------------|
| Depletes soil, water, biodiversity | Rebuilds soil, captures water, increases biodiversity |
| Takes from community | Builds community capacity |
| Externalizes costs (pollution, waste) | Internalizes loops (circular materials) |
| Short-term profit | Long-term abundance |

**In practice:**
- Every site under regenerative land management within 5 years
- Carbon-negative buildings (sequester more than embodied)
- Local materials sourced within 50km where possible
- Waste streams become input streams

---

## 3. Collaboration Over Competition

**We grow the pie, not fight for slices.**

The regenerative transition is too big for any single organization. We need thousands of builders, not one dominant company.

| Competition Mindset | Collaboration Mindset |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Protect IP, create moats | Open-source, enable forks |
| Capture market share | Expand the market for everyone |
| Win-lose negotiations | Win-win partnerships |
| Hoard knowledge | Share learnings freely |

**In practice:**
- Dual licensing: free for self-builders, commercial for scale partners
- Toloka model: community labor as mutual aid, not wage extraction
- Partner ecosystem (Kinterra) shares value fairly across the network
- Documentation and training materials freely available

---

## 4. Transparency Over Opacity

**We show our work.**

Trust is built through radical openness. We publish what others hide:

| What We Publish | Why It Matters |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **Bill of Materials** | Anyone can verify costs, source alternatives |
| **Performance data** | Real numbers, not marketing claims |
| **Financial flows** | Where money goes, who benefits |
| **Governance decisions** | How and why choices are made |
| **Failures and learnings** | Honest about what doesn't work |

**In practice:**
- Public whitepaper with full protocol specification
- On-chain token mechanics (EKLV) — auditable by anyone
- Open documentation of all building systems
- Regular reporting on ecological and social outcomes

---

## 5. Adaptability Over Rigidity

**We build for local context, not universal prescription.**

One-size-fits-all doesn't work for regeneration. Every bioregion has different:
- Climate and weather patterns
- Available materials
- Cultural building traditions
- Regulatory environments
- Community needs

| Rigid Approach | Adaptive Approach |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Franchise with exact replication | Protocol with local variation |
| Centralized control | Distributed decision-making |
| "Best practice" imposed | Context-appropriate solutions |
| Fixed designs | Modular, evolvable systems |

**In practice:**
- Climate Fortress adapts to local materials (straw, hemp, wool)
- Training programs incorporate regional building traditions
- Partners have autonomy to modify within protocol bounds
- Continuous learning loops improve the protocol over time

---

## Values Alignment with Partners

These values inform partner selection. Kinterra, as the commercial distribution partner, operates under an [Ecosystem Charter](/architecture/layer-c) with aligned values:

| Enklava Value | Kinterra Charter Equivalent |
|---------------|----------------------------|
| Sovereignty Over Dependency | Non-extraction, no lock-in |
| Regeneration Over Extraction | Regenerative mandate, patient capital |
| Collaboration Over Competition | Ecosystem participation, shared upside |
| Transparency Over Opacity | Integrity & transparency |
| Adaptability Over Rigidity | Adaptability & local relevance |

When values conflict between partners, the Golden Share mechanism ensures Enklava's foundational values prevail.

## Values in Tension

Real decisions involve tradeoffs. Here's how we navigate common tensions:

### Speed vs. Quality
**Resolution:** Quality wins. We'd rather deploy fewer excellent systems than many mediocre ones. Reputation is the long-term moat.

### Open-Source vs. Commercial Viability
**Resolution:** Dual licensing. Free for personal use (sovereignty), commercial license for scale partners (sustainability). Both can coexist.

### Local Autonomy vs. Protocol Consistency
**Resolution:** Core systems are standardized (safety, performance). Everything else adapts. "Strict on principles, flexible on methods."

### Growth vs. Regeneration
**Resolution:** Regeneration is non-negotiable. Growth that compromises regeneration is not growth — it's extraction with extra steps.

---

## How to Use These Values

**For builders:** Ask "Does this design increase sovereignty or dependency?"

**For partners:** Ask "Are we extracting or regenerating value?"

**For contributors:** Ask "Am I sharing openly or hoarding?"

**For governance:** Ask "Is this decision transparent and documented?"

**For scaling:** Ask "Does this respect local context or impose uniformity?"

When in doubt, return to the values.
