# EKLV Tokenomics

EKLV is the utility token that coordinates value across the Enklava ecosystem. It captures revenue from physical infrastructure deployment, incentivizes community contribution, and provides governance rights over protocol development.

## Token Specifications

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Asset** | EKLV |
| **Standard** | ERC-20 |
| **Network** | Polygon PoS |
| **Total Supply** | 10,000,000 (Fixed, Non-Inflationary) |
| **Seed Price** | €0.08 |
| **Initial FDV** | €800,000 |

---

## Core Functions

EKLV serves five distinct functions within the ecosystem:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Value Capture** | Protocol revenue executes continuous buybacks, linking physical growth to token value |
| **Incentive Alignment** | Contributors earn EKLV via Proof of Regenerative Work on Toloka |
| **Access Rights** | Premium experiences at Zadzim require EKLV burn |
| **Governance** | Token holders vote on protocol decisions and treasury allocation |
| **Payment Utility** | 5% discount on ecosystem services when paying in EKLV |

## Supply Design Philosophy

**Total Supply: 10,000,000 EKLV**

| Design Choice | Rationale |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Fixed Supply** | No inflation, no surprise dilution. What you see is what exists. |
| **10M Units** | Creates psychological scarcity parity with Land/Gold assets. "I own 10,000 EKLV" feels substantial. |
| **Cognitive Load** | Easy math: 1% = 100,000 EKLV. No decimal confusion. |
| **FDV Clarity** | At €0.08 seed, FDV = €800K. At €1.00, FDV = €10M. Simple multiplication. |

### Why 10 Million?

| Supply | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| 1,000,000 | At €0.08, fractional ownership feels insignificant. "I own 0.001 tokens." |
| 100,000,000 | Feels inflationary. "There are so many tokens." Price per token stays low. |
| **10,000,000** | Goldilocks zone. Substantial individual holdings, credible scarcity, clean math. |

## Network Selection

**Selected: Polygon PoS**

| Criteria | Ethereum | Polygon PoS | Arbitrum | Base |
|----------|----------|-------------|----------|------|
| **EURC Native** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| **Gas Cost** | High (€5-50) | Low (&lt;€0.01) | Low (&lt;€0.05) | Low (&lt;€0.01) |
| **Carbon Neutral** | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| **Institutional Adoption** | High | High | Medium | Medium |
| **ReFi Ecosystem** | Limited | Strong | Limited | Limited |
| **Bridge Maturity** | N/A | Mature | Mature | New |

### Decision Rationale

1. **EURC (Circle Euro):** Native availability enables Euro-denominated trading pair, critical for EU-focused operations
2. **Carbon Neutrality:** Polygon's commitment to carbon neutrality aligns with Enklava's regenerative mandate
3. **Institutional Track Record:** Major brands (Starbucks, Reddit, Nike) deployed on Polygon, signaling institutional comfort
4. **ReFi Alignment:** Polygon hosts significant ReFi projects (Toucan, KlimaDAO), creating ecosystem synergies

│    Physical Infrastructure → Revenue → Buybacks →      │
│                                                         │
│    → Burns → Scarcity → Value → More Contributors →    │
│                                                         │
│    → More Infrastructure → [REPEAT]                    │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The token is not speculative—it's backed by real revenue from real infrastructure serving real people.

## Ecosystem Network Effects

Each new Node joining the Kinterra ecosystem increases value for all existing participants. This is not merely growth—it is compounding returns:

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Shared Operational Knowledge** | Every Node generates operational data: energy yields, water efficiency, maintenance patterns, resident satisfaction. Aggregated and anonymised through Kinterra, this knowledge pool helps all partners optimise performance. A Node in Portugal benefits from lessons learned in Poland. |
| **Collective Purchasing Power** | Bulk procurement across the ecosystem reduces component costs. Technology Partners offer better terms when serving 100 Nodes than when serving 1. These savings flow to Node Partners and ultimately to residents. |
| **Amplified Governance Weight** | More participants means more perspectives in governance decisions. A diverse ecosystem makes better choices than a homogeneous one. Partners who contribute early shape the rules that govern later entrants. |
| **Demonstrated Viability** | Each operational Node is proof that the model works. This evidence compounds: the 50th Node is easier to finance than the 5th because track record exists. Early participants create the credibility that benefits all. |

These network effects create an ecosystem moat—not through exclusion, but through accumulated value that cannot be replicated by starting fresh. New entrants benefit from joining rather than competing.
