# The Four Engines of Value

The EKLV token derives value from four distinct revenue engines, each creating persistent buy pressure and/or supply reduction.

---

## The Stabilizer (Subscriptions)

**Source:** EnklavaLab subscription community (€50-200/month tiers)

**Mechanism:** **20% of Gross Subscription Revenue** is allocated to weekly EKLV buybacks.

### Revenue Projections

| Metric | Conservative | Target | Optimistic |
|--------|--------------|--------|------------|
| Subscribers | 200 | 500 | 1,000 |
| Avg. Monthly | €75 | €100 | €150 |
| Monthly Gross | €15,000 | €50,000 | €150,000 |
| Monthly Buyback (20%) | €3,000 | €10,000 | €30,000 |
| **Annual Buyback** | **€36,000** | **€120,000** | **€360,000** |

### Why Gross Revenue?

We use **Gross Revenue**, not Net Profit, to ensure transparency and prevent accounting manipulation. Buyback obligations are triggered by top-line metrics visible on the [Bio-Dashboard](/tokenomics/transparency).

---

## The Pump (Hardware Sales)

**Source:** Climate Fortress sales, franchise fees, KIT sales via Kinterra distribution

**Mechanism:** **2.5% of Gross Hardware/Franchise Revenue** is allocated to EKLV buybacks.

### Revenue Projections

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Units Sold | 5 | 20 | 50 |
| Avg. Unit Price | €40,000 | €50,000 | €60,000 |
| Gross Revenue | €200,000 | €1,000,000 | €3,000,000 |
| Buyback (2.5%) | €5,000 | €25,000 | €75,000 |

**Note:** Franchise royalties (ongoing % of franchisee revenue) also contribute to the 2.5% pool once the franchise network is operational.

---

## The Sink (Burn-to-Book)

**Source:** Premium experiences and exclusive access at Zadzim Living Lab

**Mechanism:** Users must **purchase EKLV and burn it** to access premium services. Burned tokens are permanently removed from supply.

### Experience Pricing (Estimated)

| Experience | EKLV Cost | Annual Capacity | Annual Burn |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Wellness Day Pass | 50 EKLV | 500 visits | 25,000 EKLV |
| Weekend Retreat | 200 EKLV | 100 bookings | 20,000 EKLV |
| Builder Residency (1 week) | 500 EKLV | 50 residents | 25,000 EKLV |
| Genesis Event Access | 1,000 EKLV | 20 seats | 20,000 EKLV |
| **Total Annual Burn** | | | **90,000 EKLV** |

### Burn Impact

| Token Price | 90K EKLV Burn Value |
|-------------|---------------------|
| €0.08 (Seed) | €7,200 permanently removed |
| €0.50 | €45,000 permanently removed |
| €1.00 | €90,000 permanently removed |

The higher the token price, the more valuable each burn becomes—creating a virtuous cycle.

---

## Velocity Bonus (Payment Discount)

**Source:** All ecosystem services (accommodations, workshops, products, maker space)

**Mechanism:** Users paying in EKLV receive a **5% discount** compared to fiat/EURC payments.

### Examples

| Service | Fiat Price | EKLV Price (5% off) | User Saves |
|---------|------------|---------------------|------------|
| Yurt Night | €100 | €95 equivalent | €5 |
| Workshop | €200 | €190 equivalent | €10 |
| Maker Space Day | €50 | €47.50 equivalent | €2.50 |
| Monthly Subscription | €100 | €95 equivalent | €5/month |

**Effect:** Creates natural demand for EKLV acquisition. Users buy EKLV to access discounts, increasing trading volume and liquidity depth.

| Sink (Experiences) | — | 90,000 EKLV |

### Token Acquisition at Different Prices

| €1.00 | 145,000 EKLV (1.45% of supply) |
