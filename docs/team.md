## Succession Protocol

To mitigate **"Key Person Risk"** (Bus Factor):

### Legal Prokura (Proxy)
A legally appointed proxy can act on behalf of the company if the founder is incapacitated.

### 2-of-3 Gnosis Safe Multi-sig
All treasury assets require 2 of 3 signatures:
1. Founder
2. Tech Lead
3. Legal Representative

This ensures **operational continuity independent of any individual**.
