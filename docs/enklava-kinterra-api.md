## 3. Revenue Flows

### Poland Operations (Enklava Territory)

Poland is Enklava's operational territory given language, relationships, land, workshop, and existing traction. Enklava retains operational control with full responsibility for production and installation.

#### Phase I: Pre-Fundraising (Current)

| Aspect | Terms |
|--------|-------|
| **Sales flow** | Through Kinterra (for revenue optics) |
| **Enklava share** | 85% (as vendor) |
| **Kinterra share** | 15% (procurement, coordination, learning) |
| **Execution** | Fully with Enklava |

**Purpose of Phase I:**
- Validating the sales process
- Establishing workflows
- Building revenue history
- Supporting pilot fundraising

#### Phase II: Post-Fundraising

| Aspect | Terms |
|--------|-------|
| **Trigger** | After €300-500K raised for Pilot first year |
| **Revenue flow** | Through Kinterra, paid out to Enklava |
| **Enklava share** | 50% |
| **Kinterra share** | 50% |

**Rationale:**
- Poland is strategically central for Enklava; for Kinterra, one of several territories
- Kinterra brings capital (including stable salaries for 1 year), commercialization, ecosystem building
- Enklava brings execution, land, and R&D capability

### Global Franchise Operations

Outside Poland, the model is consistent and scalable:

| Party | Revenue Share | Responsibilities |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **Local Franchisee** | Majority of revenue | Execution, holds execution risk |
| **Kinterra** | 80% of franchiser fee | Global orchestration, commercialization |
| **Enklava** | 20% of franchiser fee | IP contribution (whenever structures/systems from Enklava R&D are used) |

**IP-Eligible Systems:** Yurts, domes, Climate Fortress, or other systems developed by Enklava.

This ensures Enklava participates in global scaling of its solutions without taking on operational responsibilities outside Poland.

### Token Integration

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **EKLV Token** | Polygon PoS, 10M fixed supply |
| **Buyback source** | 40% of Layer B commercial royalties |
| **Proof of Regenerative Work** | Toloka contributions earn EKLV |

## 4. Phase I Operating Logic

Two scenarios govern the ecosystem formation phase, depending on grant outcomes.

### Core Principles

- Kinterra is the ecosystem coordination, commercialization, and replication vehicle
- Grants are accelerators, not prerequisites for viability
- Long-term value accrues through ecosystem surplus, not short-term extraction

### The €500K Alignment Trigger

Alignment between Kinterra and Enklava is triggered by Kinterra raising €500,000 in private capital and underwriting Paweł's salary.

**This trigger applies regardless of whether a public grant is awarded.**

Upon activation:
- Paweł's primary strategic focus and R&D coordination align with Kinterra's roadmap
- Enklava remains the operational execution base in Poland
- Poland execution economics transition from 85/15 to 50/50
- Kinterra gains the right to replicate the yurt business model globally
- Research priorities coordinated under Kinterra's direction

### Scenario A: Commercial Proof Mode (No Grant)

**Purpose:** Establish revenue reality and execution credibility without public funding.

**Duration:** 12 months

**Capital Allocation:**

| Category | Amount | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Salaries** | €350K | Roy, Carrine, Paweł |
| **Targeted R&D** | €150K | System integration, Climate Fortress development |
| **Total** | €500K | Minimum close |

**Activities:**

*Commercial & Ecosystem Execution:*
- Standardization of production and assembly SOPs
- Continuous yurt sales and deployments in Poland
- Vendor discovery and onboarding per partnership framework
- Market testing in secondary European markets (Germany/Spain as leading possibilities)
- Documentation of execution processes, costs, timelines

*Targeted R&D (from €150K envelope):*
- Climate Fortress prototyping
- On/near-site strawbale module experimentation
- Integrated structure, energy, and water system concepts
- Documentation for future replication

### Scenario B: Commercial Proof + Grant Acceleration

**Purpose:** Accelerate validation of distributed adoption models with public co-funding.

**Duration:** 24 months

**Grant Focus Areas:**
- Distributed fabrication (on-site, near-site, pop-up)
- Integration of structures, energy, water, and sanitation
- Operational procedures and business models
- Training and workforce pathways
- Instrumentation, monitoring, and analytics
- Cross-regional validation and replication

**Note:** Yurts remain an MVP context, not the core grant object.

**Roles Under Scenario B:**

| Entity | Role |
|--------|------|
| **Kinterra** | Grant coordination (not beneficiary), raises private capital, provides ~€150K co-funding |
| **DDModuly** | Grant beneficiary, leads machine R&D and decentralized fabrication |
| **Portuguese Entity** | Second validation hub (if included) |

**Grant Facilitation Economics:**

Kinterra's role is structural and non-extractive. Kinterra does not take fees from grant budgets.

Economic upside from grant-enabled outputs realized through:
- Origination fees where solutions are produced and delivered
- Replication fees where IP is replicated by local hubs

All grant-funded outputs perpetually licensed to Kinterra for global commercialization.

### Vendor Economic Modes

#### A. Solution Delivery (Production & Execution)

When a vendor produces and delivers a solution (manufacturing, procurement, installation):

| Mechanism | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Origination/channel fee** | Kinterra originates the deal |
| **Margin split** | Kinterra underwrites coordination capacity |

#### B. Replication via IP (No Product Sale)

When local hubs produce systems based on licensed IP without product resale:

| Party | Share | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| **Kinterra** | 80% | Ecosystem orchestration, commercialization |
| **Originating Vendor** | 20% | Core IP, system design, know-how |

This model applies globally and is independent of territory.

### Co-Creation & Narrative Coordination

Following the €500K trigger, Kinterra and Enklava operate a shared framework:

- All validated outputs documented in formats suitable for replication
- R&D agendas and documentation standards jointly defined under Kinterra coordination
- External communications coordinated to ensure coherence and prevent IP leakage
- Preserves Enklava's operational autonomy while ensuring strategic coherence

### Scenario B Open Items

Intentionally open, to be resolved during consortium formation:

- [ ] Exact technical scope of Scenario B pilots
- [ ] Lead entity for Eurostars (DDModuly vs PT entity)
- [ ] Number of machines and pilot sites
- [ ] Subcontracting mechanics
- [ ] Training monetization model

---

## 5. Subscription Community (EnklavaLab)

### Poland (Enklava-Owned)

| Aspect | Terms |
|--------|-------|
| **Ownership** | Enklava leads and owns Polish subscription community |
| **Content** | Enklava generates content and manages engagement |
| **Revenue** | Fully Enklava's (unless Kinterra contributes funding) |

**If Kinterra Contributes (~€20K):**
- Define clear revenue share
- Otherwise remains fully Enklava's in Poland
- Kinterra gets license fee to globalize content

### Global (Kinterra-Led)

Kinterra develops the global learning platform using:
- Enklava content
- Enklava documentation
- Enklava process learnings
- Enklava metrics

**Benefits:**
- Consistency in global onboarding
- Professional presentation
- Multi-language versions
- Standardized materials for future hubs

This keeps Enklava autonomy intact while allowing Kinterra to elevate and integrate knowledge into a global system.

## 6. Governance & Decision Rights

### Decision Matrix

| Decision Type | Who Decides | Input From |
|---------------|-------------|------------|
| IP development priorities | Layer B | Kinterra feedback |
| Commercial product specs | Kinterra | Layer B feasibility |
| Pricing | Kinterra | Layer B cost data |
| Brand guidelines | Joint | — |
| Open-source releases | Layer B | Kinterra notification |
| New regional partners | Kinterra | Layer B approval |

### Golden Share (Proposed)

**Concept:** Golden Share to Enklava for supporting operations governance.

**Purpose:** Guaranteeing maintained alignment per Ecosystem Charter.

**Status:** To be discussed in due time.

### Ecosystem Participation Pool (Kinterra)

From Kinterra Charter — capital providers receive governance tokens:

| Participation | Rights |
|---------------|--------|
| Financial contribution | Voting on Kinterra strategy |
| Ecosystem contribution | Additional weight |

**Open Question:** How does this interact with Enklava's EKLV governance? Potential for conflicting mandates?

### Dispute Resolution

| Level | Method |
|-------|--------|
| 1. Working | Direct discussion between teams |
| 2. Escalation | Designated representatives |
| 3. Mediation | Third-party mediator |
| 4. Arbitration | Swiss arbitration (Kinterra domicile) |

### Kinterra Charter Tensions

The Kinterra Ecosystem Charter contains provisions that may require clarification for the Enklava relationship:

| Charter Provision | Potential Conflict | Resolution Needed |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **4-year vesting** (Section 4.3) | Does Enklava's 5%→10% equity vest over time? | Clarify if equity is immediate or vesting |
| **12x salary cap** (Section 3.1) | Applies to Enklava team on Kinterra projects? | Define scope of compensation constraints |
| **IP optionality** (Section 10.1) | Kinterra may preserve patents; Enklava uses CC BY-NC-SA | Establish clear IP boundary |
| **Vendor channel fees** (Section 9) | Kinterra earns fees from vendors — Enklava is the vendor | Clarify if 15% includes channel fees |
| **Best Price Guarantee** (Section 9) | Partners must commit to transparent pricing | Confirm Enklava's pricing obligations |
| **Knowledge commons** (Section 10) | Partners contribute learnings to commons | Define what Enklava must share vs. keep |
| **€10M lifetime cap** (Section 3.2) | Individual participation capped | Applies to Enklava founders? |
| **Surplus definition** (Section 3.3) | Surplus calculated after obligations | How does 2.5% royalty interact? |

**Charter Hierarchy:** Per Kinterra Charter Section 1: "In the event of inconsistency, this Ecosystem Charter prevails over subsidiary documentation."

**Implication:** Any Enklava-Kinterra agreement is subordinate to the Charter. These tensions must be resolved explicitly in the formal agreement.

## 7. Equity & Ownership

### Enklava Stake in Kinterra

| Phase | Equity | Trigger |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Initial** | 5% | Current |
| **Post-Fundraising** | 10% | After successful fundraising |

**Rationale for 5-10% Range:**

Given that Enklava:
- Holds the Polish territory
- Earns vendor revenue (85% → 50%)
- Participates in IP-based franchise fees (20% globally)
- Can run and monetize the Polish subscription community
- Benefits from Kinterra's global growth

This reflects a meaningful partnership without:
- Placing disproportionate weight on a single region or solution set
- Binding Enklava to operational obligations in other territories

### Cross-Holdings Summary

| Holder | Stake In | Amount |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Enklava (Layer B) | Kinterra AG | 5% → 10% (post-fundraising) |
| Kinterra | Layer B | None (license relationship only) |

### Exit Scenarios

| Scenario | Consequence |
|----------|-------------|
| Kinterra IPO/acquisition | Layer B receives termination fee + continued royalty |
| Kinterra failure | License reverts to Layer B |
| Enklava failure | IP becomes pure CC BY-NC-SA (community continues) |
| Layer A dissolution | Land transfers to conservation trust |
