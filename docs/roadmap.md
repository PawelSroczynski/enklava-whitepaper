# Roadmap

This roadmap utilizes a **Branching Logic** architecture. The "Sovereign Path" is the baseline. The "Accelerator Path" is triggered only upon external capital injection.

## The Bootloader (Months 1-3)

| Track | Actions |
|-------|---------|
| **Corporate** | Register NewCo. Execute Debt Swap. |
| **Digital** | Launch EnklavaLab (Cash Flow) & Toloka Alpha. Mint Token. |
| **The Sovereign Raise** | Launch "Genesis Node" Program to raise €50k-€100k internally (selling Founder Vouchers). |

**Output:** Initial CapEx secured without VCs.

**✅ Status Update:** Toloka Platform is live at [toloka.site](https://toloka.site/) with active projects demonstrating proof-of-concept for the skill exchange model. The platform currently hosts projects across multiple categories (natural building, agricultural, renovation, environmental) and connects volunteers, hosts, and experts throughout Poland.

## The Pilot Fork (Months 4-6)

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **PATH A: THE SOVEREIGN BUILD (Baseline)** | Utilize Genesis Fund to build Climate Fortress Core (35m²) using Toloka volunteers. |
| **PATH B: THE ACCELERATOR BUILD (Optimized)** | Kinterra secures €300k+ to deploy the 190m² Microgrid. |

**Output:** Validated Prototype ("The Gold Master") ready for franchising.

## Liquidity & Utility (Months 7-12)

| Track | Actions |
|-------|---------|
| **Market** | Launch Uniswap Pool (EURC/EKLV). |
| **Yield** | Activate Liquidity Mining Rewards for investors. |
| **Digital** | Enable Token Withdrawals. |
| **Commercial** | Kinterra pre-sells first Franchise Units in EU based on Phase 2 data. |

**Output:** First external revenue and Token Buybacks.

## Long-Term Vision (Year 3+)

- **State:** Zadzim operates as a fully autonomous Microgrid Settlement.
- **Asset:** EKLV acts as the reserve currency for the regenerative construction sector.
- **Legacy:** The protocol begins issuing verified Bio-Credits based on the sensor data collected from the global ecosystem of nodes.
