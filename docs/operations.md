# Operational Protocol

Enklava follows a strict **4-Stage Evolution** of operational management to ensure infinite scalability.

**Stage 1 (Systematization):** Every operational action is recorded in the "Gold Master" Knowledge Base.

**Stage 2 (Taskification):** Replacing employment with Bounties via Toloka.

**Stage 3 (Guilds & Stewardship):**

- **The Seasonal Stewards:** Instead of permanent staff, the Zadzim site is managed by rotating Stewards (3-6 month contracts). They receive residency + tokens in exchange for managing daily ops.
- **The Incubator:** Members run autonomous revenue-generating nodes (Kitchen, Maker Space), sharing profit with the DAO.

**Stage 4 (DAO):** The Founder moves to "Lead Architect," managing budgets via Governance votes rather than daily tasks.
