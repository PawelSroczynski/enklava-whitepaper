# The Ultimate Backstop

In the event of total protocol dissolution, the Enklava Foundation holds a mandate to liquidate physical site improvements to execute a final "Terminal Buyback" for all remaining token holders, ensuring that the token is backed by tangible value even in a worst-case scenario.

# Conclusion

**Enklava is more than a place; it is a Protocol.**

By tokenizing the value created by our land, our knowledge, and our labor, we ensure that the people building the regenerative future are the ones who own it.

> **We build the Engine. You build the World.**
