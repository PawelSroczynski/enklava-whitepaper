## What is Enklava?

Civilization faces a systemic hardware crisis. The current housing model is legally rigid, financially extractive, and dependent on fragile centralized grids—energy, water, food. We are essentially **renting our lives from utility companies**.

Enklava is a **cyber-physical machine** designed to prototype, validate, and scale a **Civilization Protocol**—an incremental transition from dependent consumerism to sovereign, off-grid resilience.

We don't just build houses. We build **Autonomous Nodes**—carbon-negative habitats that:
- Generate their own power
- Harvest their own water
- Regulate their own temperature
- Pay dividends to their owners
- **Swarm together** into resilient microgrids

One node is a home. A cluster is a village. An ecosystem is a movement.

**The yurt is your first shelter. The Climate Fortress is your foundation. A swarm of nodes across Poland and Europe—that's the destination.**

## The Vision

> *From renting your life to owning it—one system at a time.*

A world where living sustainably is the most profitable choice. Where your home is not a cost center but a **revenue-generating asset**. Where communities coordinate through transparent, trustless systems to build wealth while healing the planet.

We build the Engine. **You build the World.**

## Legal Disclaimer & Risk Warning

The EKLV token is a cryptographically secured utility token designed for the Enklava Ecosystem. It does not constitute a share, security, or financial instrument under the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) or Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) guidelines. The token provides access to digital and physical services within the ecosystem. Past performance of the ecosystem does not guarantee future token value. Participation involves risks including regulatory uncertainty, market volatility, and technological failure.
