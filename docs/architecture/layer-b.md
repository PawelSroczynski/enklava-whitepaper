---

## Entity Overview

| **Type** | Polish Limited Liability Company |
| **Registration** | KRS [PLACEHOLDER: Registration Number] |

## What Layer B Controls

Layer B is the **operational heart** of Enklava — it builds, owns, and monetizes everything except the land itself.

| Domain | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **R&D** | Climate Fortress technology development |
| **IP Ownership** | All designs, software, methodologies |
| **Token Issuance** | EKLV token on Polygon |
| **Commercial Operations** | Consulting, training, licensing |
| **Tax Optimization** | Polish IP Box regime (5% CIT on IP income) |

---

## Core Functions

### 1. Technology Development

Layer B runs the **Zadzim Living Lab** — a real-world R&D facility where Climate Fortress technology is developed, tested, and documented.

| Technology Track | Status |
|------------------|--------|
| **Yurt Assembly System** | Production-ready |
| **PTES (Pit Thermal Storage)** | Prototype |
| **THRONE-GEMINI Gasifier** | In development |
| **Autonomous Grid System** | Research phase |
| **Water Harvesting** | Research phase |

All technology is developed in partnership with the **Toloka community** — open-source contributors who provide feedback, improvements, and real-world testing.

### 2. IP Ownership & Licensing

Layer B owns all intellectual property created at Zadzim, including:

- Construction blueprints and assembly manuals
- Software (monitoring, control systems, automation)
- Training curricula and methodologies
- Brand assets and documentation

**Licensing Model:**

| License Type | Terms | Recipient |
|--------------|-------|-----------|
| **Community License** | CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 | Toloka builders (non-commercial) |
| **Commercial License** | Exclusive | Kinterra (Layer C) |
| **Direct Commercial** | Per-project | Industrial clients |

See [IP Strategy →](/architecture/ip-strategy) for full details.

### 3. EKLV Token Operations

Layer B issues and manages the **EKLV utility token**.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Network** | Polygon PoS |
| **Total Supply** | 10,000,000 EKLV (fixed) |
| **Contract** | [PLACEHOLDER: Contract Address] |

**Token Flow:**

```
Commercial Revenue (Layer C)
        │
        ▼ 2.5% Royalty
┌───────────────────────┐
│   LAYER B TREASURY    │
│   (EKLV Operations)   │
└───────────────────────┘
        │
        ├──▶ 40% Buyback & Burn
        ├──▶ 30% R&D Fund
        ├──▶ 20% Community Rewards
        └──▶ 10% Operations
```

### 4. Tax Optimization

Poland offers an **IP Box regime** that taxes qualifying IP income at just 5% (instead of the standard 19% CIT).

| Requirement | Enklava Compliance |
|-------------|--------------------|
| IP created in Poland | ✓ All R&D at Zadzim |
| Documented R&D process | ✓ Open-source methodology |
| Qualified IP income | ✓ Licensing fees, royalties |

This means Layer B keeps more revenue for R&D investment while remaining fully compliant with Polish and EU tax law.

## Governance

### Ownership Structure

| Shareholder | Stake | Role |
|-------------|-------|------|
| [PLACEHOLDER: Founder] | [PLACEHOLDER: %] | Managing Director |
| [PLACEHOLDER: Co-founder] | [PLACEHOLDER: %] | Technical Director |
| [PLACEHOLDER: Other] | [PLACEHOLDER: %] | [PLACEHOLDER: Role] |

### Decision Framework

| Decision Type | Required Approval |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Day-to-day operations | Managing Director |
| Expenses > 50,000 PLN | Both Directors |
| New share issuance | Shareholder meeting (75%) |
| Charter amendments | Shareholder meeting (75%) + Court |
| Major IP licensing | Both Directors + Board advisory |

### Prokura (Commercial Power of Attorney)

For operational continuity, Layer B maintains **Prokura** — a Polish legal instrument that grants emergency commercial authority if the Managing Director becomes incapacitated.

| Prokurent | Scope | Appointed |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| [PLACEHOLDER: Name] | Full Prokura | [PLACEHOLDER: Date] |

---

## Relationship to Other Layers

### From Layer A (Foundation)

Layer B holds **exclusive commercial rights** granted by the Foundation:

| Right | Scope | Duration |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Land use | Build, operate, host | 30 years, renewable |
| IP development | Create and own | Perpetual |
| Revenue retention | 100% of commercial | Ongoing |

### To Layer C (Kinterra)

Layer B grants commercial distribution rights to Kinterra:

| Right | Scope | Terms |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Commercial IP license | Exclusive worldwide | 2.5% royalty on sales |
| Franchise rights | Climate Fortress builds | Per-unit fee |
| Training certification | Authorized installers | Annual licensing |

---

## Failure Modes & Protections

| Risk | Protection |
|------|------------|
| Director incapacitation | Prokura + succession protocol |
| Shareholder conflict | Detailed operating agreement + mediation clause |
| Cash flow crisis | Separate R&D reserve fund |
| IP theft | Registered trademarks + trade secrets + licensing tracking |
| Token exploitation | Multi-sig treasury + time-locked operations |

### What If Layer B Fails?

If Enklava Ecosystem Sp. z o.o. becomes insolvent:

1. **Land stays with Foundation** — Layer A is separate legal entity
2. **Community IP remains open-source** — CC BY-NC-SA licenses are irrevocable
3. **Commercial rights revert** — Foundation can license to new operator
4. **Token continues** — Smart contract is immutable, community can fork

The protocol survives any single layer failure.
