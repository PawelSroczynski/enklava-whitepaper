# Layer C: The Ecosystem Orchestrator

> *"They curate. They connect. They scale."*

---

## What is Layer C?

Layer C is the **ecosystem orchestrator** — the platform layer where partners discover, integrate, co-build, and transact. Where Enklava defines *what* an Autonomous Node is, Kinterra enables an *ecosystem* to form around it.

Unlike Layers A and B (which are controlled entities), Layer C operates as an **open platform** for independent businesses contributing to the ecosystem.

## Kinterra: The Orchestrator

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Entity** | Kinterra S.A. (in formation) |
| **Role** | Ecosystem Orchestrator |
| **Territory** | Global |
| **Relationship** | Platform operator, not just distributor |
| **Website** | [PLACEHOLDER: URL] |

### Orchestrator Functions

As orchestrator, Kinterra does not merely participate in the ecosystem but actively shapes it through four core functions:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Curation** | Vetting and certifying ecosystem partners. Maintaining quality thresholds that protect ecosystem integrity while remaining open to diverse contributor types. |
| **Standards** | Defining integration protocols, quality benchmarks, and interoperability requirements. Partners building for one Node can deploy across all Nodes because Kinterra enforces consistency. |
| **Facilitation** | Enabling transactions and collaborations between participants. When a Node Partner needs a Technology Partner's solution, Kinterra provides discovery, contracting, and settlement infrastructure. |
| **Governance** | Providing voice mechanisms for ecosystem-wide decisions. Partners earn governance weight through contribution, not just token holdings. |

### Kinterra's Markets

Kinterra takes **Climate Fortress technology** and packages it for commercial markets:

- Glamping resorts and eco-tourism
- Corporate retreat centers
- Emergency housing solutions
- Agricultural support structures
- Off-grid residential developments

### Why Separate Entities?

| Reason | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| **Risk isolation** | Kinterra's liabilities don't affect Layer B |
| **Capital flexibility** | Kinterra can raise its own investment |
| **Operational focus** | Layer B does R&D, Kinterra does sales |
| **Exit optionality** | Kinterra could be acquired without affecting the protocol |

---

## Partner Categories

The Kinterra ecosystem comprises four partner categories, each contributing distinct value:

| Category | Role in Ecosystem | Typical Participants |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Node Partners** | Deploy and operate Autonomous Nodes | Housing cooperatives, property developers, municipalities, intentional communities |
| **Technology Partners** | Integrate systems, components, and platforms | Energy system manufacturers, water treatment providers, building automation vendors, IoT platforms |
| **Service Partners** | Install, maintain, inspect, and certify | Licensed contractors, maintenance firms, certification bodies, engineering consultancies |
| **Strategic Partners** | Co-develop standards, research, and IP | Universities, research institutions, industry associations, standards bodies |

Partners may span multiple categories. A manufacturer (Technology Partner) might also offer installation services (Service Partner). Kinterra's registry tracks capabilities, not exclusive classifications.

### Becoming a Partner

Entry to the Kinterra ecosystem follows a progressive path:

1. **Discovery** — Explore ecosystem documentation and reference implementations
2. **Application** — Submit capability profile and alignment statement
3. **Certification** — Complete technical and operational verification
4. **Integration** — Connect systems to Kinterra protocols
5. **Activation** — Begin serving Node Partners and earning ecosystem standing
6. **Governance** — Gain voice in ecosystem decisions proportional to contribution
