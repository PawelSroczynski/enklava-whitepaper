# Layer A: The Foundation

> *The land can never be sold. The game never ends.*

---

## Entity Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Legal Entity** | Enklava Foundation (Fundacja Enklava) |
| **Type** | Polish Foundation (Fundacja) |
| **Registration** | KRS [PLACEHOLDER: Registration Number] |
| **Established** | [PLACEHOLDER: Year] |
| **Primary Asset** | 7 hectares of land in Zadzim, Gmina Zadzim, Poland |
| **Governing Law** | Ustawa o fundacjach (Polish Foundation Act) |

## What is a Polish Fundacja?

A **Fundacja** (Foundation) is a legal entity under Polish law designed to hold assets for a defined purpose — indefinitely. Unlike a company:

- It has **no shareholders** who can vote to sell assets
- It exists to fulfill a **statutory purpose**, not to generate profit
- Its assets are **legally separated** from any individual
- It can own land, receive donations, and grant usage rights

### Why Not Other Structures?

| Structure | Problem |
|-----------|---------|
| **Company (Sp. z o.o.)** | Shareholders can vote to sell assets |
| **Cooperative** | Members can dissolve and liquidate |
| **Trust** | Not recognized under Polish law |
| **DAO** | No legal standing for land ownership |

A Fundacja is the **only Polish legal structure** that can hold land in true perpetuity.

## The Asset: Zadzim Living Lab

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Location** | Zadzim, Gmina Zadzim, Łódź Voivodeship, Poland |
| **Total Area** | 7 hectares (~17 acres) |
| **Land Type** | Mixed: agricultural + settlement zoning |
| **Coordinates** | [PLACEHOLDER: GPS coordinates] |
| **Acquisition** | [PLACEHOLDER: How was land acquired] |

### Why Zadzim?

- **Low land cost** — Rural Poland, not speculative urban market
- **Favorable zoning** — Allows mixed residential/agricultural use
- **Strategic location** — Central Poland, accessible from Warsaw/Łódź
- **Community support** — Local government receptive to eco-settlement projects

## Legal Protections

### Statutory Lock

The Foundation's charter (Statut) contains a **perpetuity clause**:

> *"The Foundation's real property assets may not be sold, mortgaged, or otherwise encumbered. Any amendment to this article requires unanimous consent of all Board members and approval by the supervising Ministry."*

This means:
- No single person can sell the land
- No majority vote can sell the land
- The barrier to sale is effectively infinite

### Supervisory Authority

Polish foundations are supervised by a relevant Ministry (typically the Ministry appropriate to their purpose). Any charter changes that affect core assets require:

1. Board resolution (unanimous)
2. Ministry approval
3. Court registration

This creates **three independent gatekeepers** against asset stripping.

## Governance

### Foundation Board (Zarząd Fundacji)

| Role | Person | Appointed |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **President** | [PLACEHOLDER: Name] | [PLACEHOLDER: Date] |
| **Vice President** | [PLACEHOLDER: Name] | [PLACEHOLDER: Date] |
| **Secretary** | [PLACEHOLDER: Name] | [PLACEHOLDER: Date] |

### Decision Rights

| Decision Type | Required Approval |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Day-to-day operations | President alone |
| Granting commercial rights | Board majority |
| Charter amendments (non-core) | Board majority + Ministry notification |
| Charter amendments (core assets) | Board unanimous + Ministry approval |
| Dissolution | Board unanimous + Ministry approval + Court |

---

## Relationship to Layer B

The Foundation grants **exclusive commercial rights** to Enklava Ecosystem Sp. z o.o. (Layer B) through a formal agreement:

| Right | Scope | Duration |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Land use** | Build, operate, host guests | 30 years, renewable |
| **IP development** | Create and own IP from site activities | Perpetual |
| **Revenue retention** | Keep 100% of commercial revenue | Ongoing |

In exchange, Layer B:
- Maintains the property
- Pays property taxes
- Develops the Climate Fortress technology
- Builds the community

### What If Layer B Fails?

If Enklava Ecosystem Sp. z o.o. goes bankrupt or dissolves:

1. Commercial rights revert to the Foundation
2. Land remains with the Foundation
3. Foundation can grant rights to a new operator
4. **The land is never liquidated**

This is the infinite game in legal form.

## Failure Modes & Protections

| Risk | Protection |
|------|------------|
| Board corruption | Ministry supervision + charter lock |
| Hostile takeover | No shares to acquire |
| Forced sale (creditors) | Foundation assets separate from any company debt |
| Government seizure | Constitutional property rights + EU law |
| Founder death | Board continuity + succession protocol |
