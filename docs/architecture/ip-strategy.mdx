# IP Strategy: Dual Licensing

> *"Open for builders. Protected for profit."*

---

## The Core Insight

Traditional IP models force a choice: **open-source** (anyone can use it, no revenue) or **proprietary** (revenue, but no community).

Enklava rejects this binary. We use **dual licensing** — the same approach used by open hardware pioneers like Prusa Research, Arduino, and FarmBot.

---

## Learning from Open Hardware Pioneers

Before defining our approach, we studied companies that navigated this challenge before us.

### AllPowerLabs: The Open-to-Proprietary Journey

[AllPowerLabs](https://www.allpowerlabs.com) started in 2008 with the **Gasifier Experimenter's Kit (GEK)** — fully open-source biomass gasification technology.

> *"APL's initial goal was education and experimentation in open-source alternative energy technologies, to create a do-it-yourself (DIY) power-hacking culture."*
> — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Power_Labs)

| Phase | Model | Outcome |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 2008-2013 | Open-source GEK kits | Plans and CAD files freely available |
| 2013+ | Proprietary Power Pallet | Patent-protected, commercial focus |
| Today | Hybrid | Early designs still curated and available; commercial products proprietary |

**Key lesson:** By 2013, AllPowerLabs reached 500 machines in ~40 countries but found open-source alone couldn't sustain R&D. They transitioned to proprietary for commercial products while maintaining educational resources.

**Enklava's approach:** We learn from APL's journey but **start with dual-licensing** rather than transitioning later — avoiding the community friction of "closing" what was open.

### FarmBot: Freedom with Boundaries

[FarmBot](https://farm.bot) uses **permissive licensing for functional work** but restricts commercial use of brand assets.

> *"These freedoms are vitally important... especially when it comes to technologies related to fundamental human needs, such as the ability to grow food."*
> — [FarmBot: Respecting Your Freedom](https://meta.farm.bot/v2025/farmbot/intro/respecting-your-freedom.html)

| Asset Type | License | Commercial Use |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| Hardware designs | Permissive open-source | Allowed |
| Software | Permissive open-source | Allowed |
| Documentation | Permissive open-source | Allowed |
| Brand/marketing | Restricted | Requires permission |

**Key insight:** FarmBot maintains profitability by being the **trusted manufacturer and support provider** — not through licensing restrictions on the technology itself.

### Prusa Research: The Open Community License

In December 2024, [Prusa Research](https://www.prusa3d.com) introduced the **Open Community License (OCL)** — a template for modern open hardware.

> *"The OCL is designed to fill the gaps left by traditional software licenses when applied to physical objects."*
> — [Prusa Blog](https://blog.prusa3d.com/core-one-cad-files-release-under-the-new-open-community-license-ocl_127290/)

| Feature | Permissive (MIT/CC0) | OCL | Enklava (CC BY-NC-SA) |
|---------|---------------------|-----|----------------------|
| Source access | Full | Full | Full |
| Commercial resale | Allowed | Prohibited w/o agreement | Prohibited w/o agreement |
| Internal business use | Allowed | Explicitly allowed | Allowed (non-commercial) |
| Patent protection | None | Explicit grant | Via copyright |
| Primary enforcement | Copyright/IP | Breach of contract | Copyright + contract |

**Why Prusa shifted:** The "Asian Clone Paradox" — large manufacturers legally replicating open designs, undercutting developers who bore R&D costs.

**Revenue model:** Prusa captures value through **assembly premiums** (163% for pre-assembled vs. kit) and recurring consumables (Prusament filament).

### Framework Computer: Ecosystem Monetization

[Framework](https://frame.work) releases open specifications while monetizing the **ecosystem** rather than restricting access.

| Revenue Stream | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| First-party hardware | Direct laptop/desktop sales |
| Ecosystem marketplace | Commissions on third-party modules |
| Service aggregator | Professional repair matching |
| Strategic partnerships | Exclusivity windows for module makers |

**Key insight:** Open designs enable a **multi-sided marketplace** — Framework profits from the entire product lifecycle, not just initial sale.

---

## The 2025 Licensing Landscape

The global open-source services market reached **$49 billion** in 2025, with 96% of organizations maintaining or increasing reliance on open systems.

| Model | Financial Sustainability | Supply Chain Resilience | Example |
|-------|--------------------------|------------------------|---------|
| **Pure Open** | Moderate (service-dependent) | High (open spares) | FarmBot |
| **Hybrid/Source-Available** | High (captures ecosystem value) | Maximum (modular/multi-source) | Framework, Prusa, Arduino |
| **Proprietary** | Maximum (high margins) | Moderate (single-source risk) | Apple, Dell |

> *"The Hybrid/Source-Available model has emerged as the most resilient and adaptable architectural choice for the volatile global economy of 2025."*

## How Enklava's Model Works

<LightboxImage src="/img/ipstrategy.jpeg" alt="Enklava Dual Licensing Model" caption="Click to enlarge" />

### Why CC BY-NC-SA (Not OCL or Permissive)

| Consideration | Our Choice |
|---------------|------------|
| **Mission alignment** | Technologies for basic needs should be free for personal use |
| **Clone protection** | NC clause prevents commercial exploitation without agreement |
| **Community contribution** | SA clause ensures improvements stay open |
| **Legal simplicity** | CC licenses are well-understood globally |

---

## Community License: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

### What It Means

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **BY** (Attribution) | Credit Enklava as the source |
| **NC** (Non-Commercial) | Can't sell products based on this |
| **SA** (Share-Alike) | Derivatives must use same license |

### Who Can Use It

- **Self-builders** constructing their own shelter
- **Educators** teaching sustainable building
- **Researchers** studying the technology
- **Makers** experimenting and improving
- **NGOs** deploying for humanitarian purposes

### What's Included

| Asset Type | Example |
|------------|---------|
| **Blueprints** | Climate Fortress structural designs |

|---------|-------------|
| **Free access** | Build your own without cost |
| **Learning** | Full documentation for education |
| **Contribution** | Improvements flow back |
| **Trust** | License is irrevocable |

### For Commercial Partners (Kinterra)

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Competitive moat** | Exclusive commercial rights |
| **Quality assurance** | Maintained by Layer B |
| **Updates** | Continuous improvement |
| **Community validation** | Thousands of users test the tech |

### For Enklava (Layer B)

| Benefit | Explanation |

## The Contribution Model

### How Community Improvements Flow

<LightboxImage src="/img/ipstr-2.jpeg" alt="Community Contribution Flow" caption="Click to enlarge" />

### Community R&D Value

Open hardware pioneers demonstrate quantifiable R&D cost reduction:

| Company | Community Contribution | Value |
|---------|----------------------|-------|
| **Arduino** | APS Engineering used community libraries | $2,700+ saved per unit vs. PLCs |
| **Arduino** | AMB Vapor Monitoring used Arduino Cloud | "Hundreds of thousands" in licensing fees saved |
| **Framework** | Community-developed expansion modules | Reduced internal R&D for niche accessories |

### Contributor Agreement

To ensure Layer B can offer commercial licenses, contributors agree to:

1. **Grant commercial rights** — Layer B can include contributions in commercial license
2. **Maintain open license** — Contribution stays CC BY-NC-SA forever
3. **No compensation required** — Unless negotiated separately

This is the same model used by MongoDB, Elastic, and other dual-license projects.

## IP Registration & Protection

### Registered Assets

| Type | Asset | Jurisdiction |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Trademark** | "Enklava" | EU, Poland |
| **Trademark** | "Climate Fortress" | EU, Poland |
| **Trade Secret** | Assembly optimization methods | N/A |
| **Copyright** | All documentation | Automatic |

### Protection Strategy

| Threat | Response |
|--------|----------|
| **Commercial use without license** | Cease & desist → Litigation |
| **Trademark infringement** | Brand enforcement |
| **Open-source violation** | Community reporting → Legal action |
| **Counterfeiting** | Quality certification program |

## Common Questions

### Can I sell a yurt I built using Enklava designs?

**No** — selling requires commercial license. But you can:
- Build for yourself (personal use)
- Build for family/friends (gift, no payment)
- Teach others how to build (education)

*This matches FarmBot's approach: "all people and organizations have the freedom to use the work in any way" — but commercial resale requires partnership.*

### Can I modify the designs?

**Yes** — under CC BY-NC-SA, you can modify freely. Your modifications must also be CC BY-NC-SA.

### What if I want to use this commercially?

Contact Kinterra for franchise/partner opportunities, or Layer B for direct licensing discussions for special cases.

### Is the license irrevocable?

**Yes** — once published under CC BY-NC-SA, that version remains free forever. We can change licensing for future versions, but published content can't be "un-freed."

### Why not fully open like FarmBot?

FarmBot uses permissive licensing because they're the **primary manufacturer** — their business model relies on being the trusted provider, not licensing revenue. Enklava's model includes **Kinterra as a distribution partner**, requiring exclusive commercial rights to justify their investment in global scaling.

---

## Future Considerations

### When Commercial Exclusivity Ends

After Kinterra's exclusivity period:
- Layer B may grant additional commercial licenses
- Existing community license continues unchanged
- Kinterra retains non-exclusive commercial rights

### Open-Source Escalation

If Enklava ceases operations:
- All IP reverts to pure CC BY-NC-SA (no commercial restrictions)
- Community can fork and continue development
- Protocol survives organizational failure

*This is the ultimate mission protection — technology for basic needs cannot be locked away.*
