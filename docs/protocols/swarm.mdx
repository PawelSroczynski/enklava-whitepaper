# Swarm Protocol

> *One node is a house. A swarm is a civilization.*

---

## The Dependency

| What You Rent | The Risk |
|---------------|----------|
| Atomized suburbs | No mutual aid, no shared resources |
| Nuclear family only | Single point of failure for care |
| Professional services | Everything costs money |
| Government safety net | Underfunded, bureaucratic, conditional |
| Social media "connection" | Dopamine, not help when you need it |

Modern life is designed for isolation. You're surrounded by strangers who owe you nothing.

---

## The Solution

Enklava builds **Swarms** — interconnected nodes that share resources, labor, and governance.

### The Scale Progression

<LightboxImage src="/img/swarm.jpeg" alt="The Scale Progression - From Node to Network" caption="Click to enlarge" />

| Scale | Size | Function |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Node** | 1 household | Self-sufficient unit (Climate Fortress + Energy + Water + Food) |
| **Cluster** | 3-4 nodes | Shared microgrid, tools, childcare, emergency backup |
| **Settlement** | 12+ nodes | Maker Space, Agora, PTES, governance, events |
| **Network** | Multiple settlements | Knowledge + token exchange across locations |

---

## Components

### 1. Toloka (Labor Coordination)

The digital platform for organizing communal work.

| Feature | Function |
|---------|----------|
| **Project Discovery** | Browse building projects by location, type, date |
| **Project Creation** | 7-step wizard for hosts |
| **Role System** | Volunteer, Host, Expert |
| **Reputation** | Track contributions, build trust |
| **Knowledge Base** | SOPs, templates, case studies |
| **My Dashboard** | Centralized view of all projects |

**URL:** [toloka.site](https://toloka.site)

### Three Roles

| Role | Polish | Gives | Gets |
|------|--------|-------|------|
| **Volunteer** | Tłoker | Time, energy | Skills, experience, EKLV |
| **Host** | Gospodarz | Space, materials, guidance | Labor, community |
| **Expert** | Mistrz | Knowledge, mentorship | Status, EKLV, teaching opportunities |

### Active Project Types

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Natural building | Yurt construction, straw bale, earth plaster |
| Agricultural | Beekeeping, traditional orchards, community gardens |
| Renovation | Barn restoration, heritage preservation |
| Environmental | Tree planting, watershed restoration |

### 2. Governance (Decision Making)

How the swarm decides.

| Decision Type | Method | Threshold |
|---------------|--------|-----------|
| **Day-to-day** | Individual autonomy | None needed |
| **Cluster resources** | Consent-based | Affected parties |
| **Settlement policy** | Token voting | >50% of participating stake |
| **Protocol changes** | Multi-sig + token | >67% + core team |

### Do-ocracy Principle

> *Those who do, decide.*

Governance weighted by contribution, not just token holdings:
- Building hours
- Hosting events
- Creating documentation
- Code contributions
- Financial support

All tracked, all verifiable.

### 3. Wellness (Health Infrastructure)

Physical and mental health as shared infrastructure.

| Facility | Function |
|----------|----------|
| **Sauna** | Heat therapy, social gathering |
| **Ice plunge** | Cold exposure, resilience |
| **Bio-hack stations** | DIY health monitoring |
| **Quiet spaces** | Meditation, reflection |
| **Movement areas** | Yoga, exercise, play |

Shared at settlement scale. Scheduled via Toloka.

### 4. Agora (Gathering Space)

The heart of the settlement.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Co-working** | Desks, internet, focus space |
| **Meeting room** | Governance, planning, workshops |
| **Kitchen** | Communal cooking, events |
| **Event space** | Festivals, markets, celebrations |
| **Pop-ups** | Member-run restaurants, shops |

### 5. Token Economy

EKLV as the coordination layer.

| Action | EKLV Flow |
|--------|-----------|
| **Toloka contribution** | Earn via Proof of Regenerative Work |
| **Surplus trading** | Pay neighbor for excess vegetables |
| **Microgrid participation** | Earn from energy sharing |
| **Governance voting** | Stake to participate |
| **Equipment access** | Pay for Maker Space time |

---

## Mutual Aid Protocols

### Emergency Response

| Emergency | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Medical** | Trained first responders in each cluster |
| **Fire** | Equipment + drills + water reserves |
| **Power outage** | Microgrid auto-balances |
| **Water shortage** | Shared reserves + rationing protocol |
| **Personal crisis** | Community support fund + labor bank |

### Labor Bank

Time-based exchange beyond token economy:

| Contribute | Receive |
|------------|---------|
| 4 hours childcare | 4 hours construction help |
| Garden surplus | Preserved food in winter |
| Transportation | Tool lending |
| Eldercare | Youth mentorship |

Tracked informally. Trust-based. Community-enforced.

---

## Integration

### ← All Protocols

The Swarm Protocol is the **coordination layer** for everything else:

| Protocol | Swarm Integration |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Shelter** | Toloka organizes builds |
| **Energy** | Microgrid shares power |
| **Water** | Emergency reserves shared |
| **Food** | Surplus trading, seed exchange |
| **Knowledge** | Skill sharing, apprenticeships |

### Network Effects

Each new node strengthens the swarm:

| Nodes | Capability |
|-------|------------|
| 1 | Self-sufficient household |
| 3-4 | Microgrid, basic mutual aid |
| 12+ | Full settlement infrastructure |
| 50+ | Political influence, purchasing power |
| 100+ | Movement, replication capability |

---

## Onboarding Path

### How to Join the Swarm

| Stage | Duration | What Happens |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **1. Discover** | 1 day | Find Toloka, browse projects |
| **2. Participate** | 1-3 events | Volunteer at a Toloka |
| **3. Learn** | 3-6 months | Build skills, earn reputation |
| **4. Commit** | Decision | Decide to build/join a node |
| **5. Build** | 1-2 years | Create your node with swarm help |
| **6. Contribute** | Ongoing | Host Tolokas, mentor others |

### Avatar Paths

| Avatar | Entry | Swarm Role |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **A (Investor)** | Fund a glamping unit | Passive income, governance |
| **B (Self-Builder)** | Join Toloka as volunteer | Build own node, help others |
| **C (Institutional)** | License for emergency housing | Deploy at scale, contribute learnings |
| **D (Builder)** | Lead Toloka projects | Core team, earn EKLV |

## Economics

### Value of Swarm Membership

| Benefit | Estimated Value (€/year) |
|---------|-------------------------|
| Labor exchange | 2,000-5,000 (at €20/hr) |
| Bulk purchasing | 500-1,000 (20% savings) |
| Shared infrastructure | 1,000-2,000 (amortized) |
| Emergency insurance | 500-1,000 (coverage value) |
| Social connection | Priceless |

### EKLV Distribution

| Allocation | % of Supply | Recipient |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| Community/Toloka | 25% | Active contributors |
| DAO Treasury | 10% | Collective decisions |
| **Total community** | **35%** | **Swarm ownership** |

The swarm owns the protocol.
