# Food Protocol

> *Grow what you eat. Eat what you grow.*

---

## The Dependency

| What You Rent | Annual Cost | The Risk |
|---------------|-------------|----------|
| Groceries | €4,000-6,000 | Price inflation, supply chain fragility |
| Restaurant/delivery | €1,000-3,000 | Convenience addiction |
| Food waste | €500-800 | 30% of purchases thrown away |
| Health costs | Variable | Poor nutrition → chronic disease |

**Total:** €5,500-10,000/year on food you don't control.

Average supermarket item travels 1,500+ km. Nutrition degrades with every hour post-harvest. Prices controlled by forces you can't influence.

---

## The Solution

Enklava builds **Cultivation Systems** — year-round food production integrated with shelter, water, and energy.

### Target: 60-80% Self-Sufficiency

Not 100%. That's a trap.

| Category | Self-Production | Trade/Purchase |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Vegetables** | 80-90% | Specialty items |
| **Fruits** | 60-70% | Tropical, exotic |
| **Eggs/dairy** | 50-80% | Scale dependent |
| **Grains** | 0-20% | Space intensive |
| **Protein** | 20-50% | Legumes, small livestock |

Trade with neighbors for variety. Buy what you can't grow efficiently.

## Components

### 1. Attached Greenhouse (30-40% of diet)

The primary production unit — thermally integrated with the Climate Fortress.

#### Year-Round Production

| Season | Primary Crops |
|--------|--------------|
| **Winter** | Leafy greens, sprouts, microgreens |
| **Spring** | Seedlings, early salads, radishes |
| **Summer** | Tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers |
| **Fall** | Extended harvest, storage crops |

### 2. Kitchen Garden (20-30% of diet)

Outdoor production for main-season abundance.

| **Berry patch** | Currants, gooseberries, raspberries | 20-30m² |
| **Potato/squash** | Calorie crops | 30-50m² |

**Total area:** 100-200m² for a household.

### 3. Food Forest (10-20% of diet)

Perennial polyculture — plant once, harvest for decades.

| Time to Harvest | Crops |
|-----------------|-------|
| Year 1-2 | Ground covers, herbs |
| Year 2-3 | Berries, small fruits |
| Year 3-5 | Tree fruits begin |
| Year 5-10 | Full production |

**Investment:** High labor upfront, minimal after establishment.

### 4. Preservation (Extends All)

Harvest abundance → year-round availability.

| Method | Best For | Shelf Life |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Fermentation** | Vegetables (sauerkraut, kimchi) | 1+ year |
| **Drying** | Herbs, fruits, tomatoes | 1-2 years |
| **Freezing** | Berries, vegetables, prepared foods | 6-12 months |
| **Canning** | Fruits, sauces, soups | 2-5 years |
| **Root cellar** | Potatoes, carrots, cabbage | 6-9 months |

## Economics

### Production Value

| System | Setup Cost (€) | Annual Yield (kg) | Market Value (€) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Greenhouse 20m² | 3,000 | 200-400 | 600-1,200 |
| Kitchen garden 100m² | 500 | 300-500 | 900-1,500 |
| Food forest 500m² | 2,000 | 100-300* | 300-900 |
| Preservation equipment | 500 | — | Extends value |
| **Total** | **6,000** | **600-1,200** | **1,800-3,600** |

*Food forest production increases yearly. Year 10+: 500+ kg.

### Payback

| Comparison | Annual |
|------------|--------|
| Grocery bill (before) | €5,000-7,000 |
| Grocery bill (after) | €1,500-2,500 |
| **Savings** | **€3,500-4,500** |
| **Payback on €6,000** | **1.5-2 years** |

Plus: Better nutrition. No pesticides. Fresh daily. Resilience.

## Livestock Integration

Optional but powerful for nutrient cycling and protein.

### Appropriate Scale

| Animal | Space Needed | Output | Labor |
|--------|--------------|--------|-------|
| **Chickens (5-10)** | 50-100m² | 200+ eggs/month | Low |
| **Ducks (4-6)** | 100m² + pond | Eggs, pest control | Low |
| **Rabbits (breeding trio)** | 10m² hutch | 50+ kg meat/year | Medium |
| **Goats (2)** | 500m² pasture | Milk, brush clearing | Medium |
| **Bees (2 hives)** | Minimal | 20-40 kg honey/year | Low |

### Nutrient Cycling

```
Kitchen scraps → Chickens → Manure → Compost → Garden → Food → Kitchen
                    ↓
                  Eggs
```

Closed loop. No external fertilizer needed.

## Soil Building

The real investment is underground.

### The Living Soil Protocol

| Practice | Purpose | Frequency |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **No-dig gardening** | Preserve soil structure | Permanent |
| **Composting** | Feed soil biology | Continuous |
| **Cover cropping** | Nitrogen fixation, erosion | Off-season |
| **Mulching** | Moisture, temperature, biology | Permanent |
| **Biochar** | Carbon sequestration, retention | Once |

**Result:** Soil improves yearly. Yields increase. Inputs decrease.
