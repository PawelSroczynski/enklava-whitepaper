# Shelter Protocol

> *The yurt is your first shelter. The Climate Fortress is your foundation.*

---

## The Dependency

| What You Rent | Annual Cost | The Risk |
|---------------|-------------|----------|
| Mortgage | €12,000+ | 30 years of debt servitude |
| Rent | €10,000+ | Permanent extraction, no equity |
| Maintenance | €2,000+ | Dependent on contractors |
| Insurance | €1,000+ | Required by lenders |

**Total:** €15,000-25,000/year just to exist in four walls.

The house doesn't generate value. It extracts it.

---

## The Solution

Enklava builds **Autonomous Shelter** — housing you own outright, assembled by community labor, designed for incremental expansion.

### Phase A: First Shelter (Yurt)

The yurt is not primitive. It's *strategic*.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Assembly time** | 3-5 days |
| **Foundation** | None required (platform or ground) |
| **Habitation** | Year-round with proper insulation |
| **Cost** | 15,000-25,000 PLN (~€3,500-6,000) |
| **Legal status** | Temporary structure (easier permits) |
| **Lifespan** | 15-20 years with maintenance |

**Why start here:**
- Immediate shelter while building permanent structure
- Cash flow via glamping/Airbnb during transition
- Learn building skills at low risk
- Test the land before committing

### Phase B: Foundation (Climate Fortress)

The Climate Fortress is the core IP — a prefabricated bio-panel system designed for the next 100 years.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Structure** | Timber frame + bio-panel infill |
| **Insulation** | High-density straw/hemp (U-value < 0.15 W/m²K) |
| **Thermal mass** | Clay/sand interior (passive temperature regulation) |
| **Expansion** | 20m² → 190m² without breaking thermal envelope |
| **Carbon** | Net negative (sequesters more than construction emits) |
| **Cost** | 150,000-300,000 PLN (50% of conventional) |
| **Assembly** | 2-4 weeks with trained crew |

### Thermal Performance

| Metric | Climate Fortress | Conventional | Passive House |
|--------|------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **U-value (walls)** | 0.12-0.15 | 0.25-0.35 | ≤0.15 |
| **Airtightness** | ≤0.6 ACH | 3-5 ACH | ≤0.6 ACH |
| **Heating demand** | ≤15 kWh/m²/year | 80-120 | ≤15 |
| **Cooling demand** | Passive (thermal mass) | Active AC | Passive |

### Modular Expansion

The Climate Fortress grows with you:

| Stage | Size | Function | Cost |
|-------|------|----------|------|
| **Core** | 20-40m² | Studio/couple | Base unit |
| **+Wing A** | +30m² | Bedroom/office | +40% |
| **+Wing B** | +30m² | Workshop/guest | +40% |
| **+Greenhouse** | +20m² | Food/thermal buffer | +25% |
| **Full build** | 120-190m² | Multi-generational | Complete |

Each addition connects without breaking the thermal envelope.

## Assembly Methodology

### The Toloka Build

Climate Fortress is designed for **community assembly** — not because it's cheaper (though it is), but because it's better.

| Phase | Duration | Team | What Happens |
|-------|----------|------|--------------|
| **Prep** | 1-2 days | 4-6 people | Foundation, material staging |
| **Frame** | 2-3 days | 6-8 people | Timber frame erection |
| **Infill** | 3-5 days | 8-12 people | Bio-panel installation |
| **Seal** | 2-3 days | 4-6 people | Weather barrier, airtightness |
| **Finish** | 5-10 days | 4-6 people | Plaster, systems, interior |

**Total:** 2-4 weeks (vs. 6-12 months conventional)

### Quality Control

| Checkpoint | Method | Standard |
|------------|--------|----------|
| **Foundation level** | Laser level | ±5mm |
| **Frame square** | Diagonal measure | ±10mm |
| **Insulation density** | Compression test | 90-110 kg/m³ |
| **Airtightness** | Blower door test | ≤0.6 ACH@50Pa |
| **Thermal bridges** | IR camera scan | No cold spots |

### Payback Period

If renting at €800/month while saving for conventional:
- Conventional: 15+ years to ownership
